-- Table Logins:

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | id            | int     |
-- | login_date    | date    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
-- This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.
 

-- Write an SQL query to find the id and the name of active users.

-- Active users are those who logged in to their accounts for 5 or more consecutive days.

-- Return the result table ordered by the id.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Accounts table:
-- +----+----------+
-- | id | name     |
-- +----+----------+
-- | 1  | Winston  |
-- | 7  | Jonathan |
-- +----+----------+

-- Logins table:
-- +----+------------+
-- | id | login_date |
-- +----+------------+
-- | 7  | 2020-05-30 |
-- | 1  | 2020-05-30 |
-- | 7  | 2020-05-31 |
-- | 7  | 2020-06-01 |
-- | 7  | 2020-06-02 |
-- | 7  | 2020-06-02 |
-- | 7  | 2020-06-03 |
-- | 1  | 2020-06-07 |
-- | 7  | 2020-06-10 |
-- +----+------------+

-- Result table:
-- +----+----------+
-- | id | name     |
-- +----+----------+
-- | 7  | Jonathan |
-- +----+----------+
-- User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
-- User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.
-- Follow up question:
-- Can you write a general solution if the active users are those who logged in to their accounts for n or more consecutive days?
